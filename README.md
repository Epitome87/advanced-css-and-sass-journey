# Advanced CSS & SASS - My Journey!

This is simply a repository that maintains my progress through Jonas Schmedtmann's Udemy course. My goal is to further strengthen my CSS (and SASS) knowledge by following Jonas as he creates webpages that are a bit more fleshed out than those in other resources I've followed.

## Section 1: Natours Project

The first project (of what looks like three) in the course. It is a landing page for a company that provides "exciting tours for adventurous people."

## My Progress So Far

As of 9/27/2021, I am about half-way through the Natours project.
